# Hi, I'm Cajsa!

I'm an aspiring full stack developer with previous experience as a team lead and project coordinator in a non-for-profit organisation and I'm familiar with working in an Agile environment. 

At the moment I'm participating in the intense full stack program at Integrify to really enhance my skills. 

As of now, I am most confident in JavaScript, TypeScript, C# and Python. The React ecosystem is my second home and I have completed various projects using Node.js, Express, ASP.NET core, EF core, REST APIs, PostgresQL, Docker, Cypress, MongoDB, Jest, XUnit etc. On the frontend, I have implemented complex state management using technologies like Redux and React Query. Additionally, I have recently got into DevOps and Kubernetes.

I am very interested in all things code and eager to continuously develop and learn more. I work hard and I am a problem solving addict.
