# Hi, I'm Cajsa!

Software developer by day and coder by night. What started as a harmless hobby transformed into a growing passion for software development and in 2023 I left my previous job to chase my dream of becoming the best developer possible.

As of now, I am most confident in JavaScript, TypeScript, C# and Python. The React ecosystem is my second home and I have completed various projects using Node.js, Express, ASP.NET core, EF core, GraphQL, PostgresQL, Docker, Cypress, MongoDB, Jest etc. On the frontend, I have implemented complex state management using technologies like Redux and React Query. Additionally, I have recently got into DevOps and Kubernetes.

I am very interested in all things code and eager to continuously develop and learn more. I work hard and I am a problem solving addict.
